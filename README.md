Raspberry Pi & Silabs C8051F340 (I2C)
=====================================

This tutorial shows how to communicate between a **Raspberry Pi** and a **Silicon Laboratories C8051F340** board by **I2C**.

### Libraries

* Pi4J 0.0.5

The installation of the Pi4J library is explained on [their website](http://pi4j.com/install.html).

### Boards connection

The following table describes the connection between the two boards:

| Pin name  | Silabs F340 | RPi GPIO P1 Header | Pi4J #    |
| --------- |:-----------:|:------------------:|:---------:|
|  GND      | GND         | P1.6               |  - (0v)   |
|  SDA      | P0.0 (SDA)  | P1.3               |  8 (SDA0) |
|  SCL      | P0.1 (SCL)  | P1.5               |  9 (SCL0) |

> Careful though, the `Vcc` should be at 3.3V as we are using the **Raspberry Pi** as master.
We have to make sure the circuit that will be connected with is also powered on 3.3V. Otherwise, we will have to create an interface circuit. Check the [RPi GPIO Interface Circuits](http://elinux.org/RPi_GPIO_Interface_Circuits#Level_Shifters) for more info.

### Silabs F340

We are going to use the Silabs Application Notes [SMBus Communication for Small Form Factor Device Families](http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/TechnicalDocs/an141.pdf). When running, the F340 will send back the data that has been received.

Use the [Silicon Labs IDE](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/8-bit-microcontroller-software.aspx#ide) to open the `SMBusTest.wsp` project file inside the [F340 directory](https://github.com/ThmX/raspi-silabs-i2c/tree/master/f340/) to compile and run this example.

### Raspberry Pi (with Pi4J)

Use the sbt project inside the [raspi directory](https://github.com/ThmX/raspi-silabs-i2c/tree/master/raspi/) to compile and run this example.

	$ sbt test

This will launch the `I2CTest` test which should connect to the I2C, write data on the bus and read back the data from the **F340**.
